# NClient

A fork and continuation of Dar9586's unofficial [NHentaiV2](https://github.com/Dar9586/NClientV2) Android Client, now renamed to just NClient.

Thanks to Dar9586 and the [other contributors](https://github.com/Dar9586/NClientV2?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors) for creating and maintaining the original project.

## Project Status

This fork is currently being rewritten to use a modern technology stack and
more layered architecture. The new tech stack will include the following:

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Decompose
- SQLDelight
- Coil
- Ktor
- Koin

There won't be any release builds until, most, if not all, legacy code is
replaced.

There will also, most likely, not be any backwards compatibility for users of
the existing NClientV2 app.
